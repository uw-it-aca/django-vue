#
# Example GitHub Actions config that drives UW-IT AXD2 integration and deployment
#
# Preconditions:
#
#  1) Application docker build is based on django-container
#
#  2) Application test suite is kicked off in docker/test.sh
#
#  3) Application repo has access to the two secrets
#     at https://github.com/organizations/uw-it-aca/settings/secrets:
#
#     GH_AUTH_TOKEN: Grants access to private flux deployment repo
#     GCP_JSON_KEY: Grants access to Google Cloud Registry
#
# To adapt this config file to a specific django project:
#
#  1) Set RELEASE_NAME suitable for deployment to k8s. RELEASE_NAME must
#     match the "repo" value in docker/*-values.yml.
#
#  2) Set DJANGO_APP to the name of the django project name/directory.
#
#  3) Verify that the lists of branches for push/pull_request is appropriate,
#     and add other branch names if needed.  Additional branch names must
#     also have steps defined in the deploy job
#
#  4) Confirm that the build steps are suitable.  Likely they are, but
#     some projects have an intermediate build step that could benefit
#     from caching, so it may be useful to augment the build steps.
